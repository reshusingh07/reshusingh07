- Hi ðŸ‘‹ , Iâ€™m Reshu


I'm a Second-year undergraduate at Teerthanker Mahaveer University, I'm working on personal 
projects to sharpen my skills and learning new tech stacks that would help in my 
personal growth and building my projects. I love problem-solving and am always ready to
help. Excited to connect with fellow
enthusiasts and explore collaborative opportunities!
